Horizontal bar chart for top 10 countries

Histogram for population distribution

Multi-line comparison of major countries

🔍 Key Findings
Global Demographics

1960 Population: ~3.0 billion

2023 Population: ~8.0 billion

Overall Growth: 160%+ increase

Trend: Sustained growth with gradual deceleration

Population Concentration

Top 10 countries account for ~58% of global population

Population distribution is highly right-skewed

Majority of countries have populations under 100 million

Growth Patterns

India surpassed China as the most populous nation (~2023)

Asia hosts ~60% of the world’s population

Africa exhibits the highest recent growth rates

Developed nations show stable or slower growth

📊 Visualizations Included
